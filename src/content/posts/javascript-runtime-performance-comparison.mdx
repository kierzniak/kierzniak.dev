The JavaScript ecosystem has evolved significantly over the past few years, with new runtimes challenging Node.js's dominance. In this post, we'll compare the performance characteristics of three major JavaScript runtimes: Node.js, Bun, and Deno.

## HTTP Server Performance

One of the most common use cases for JavaScript runtimes is building HTTP servers. Let's see how each runtime performs under load:

<BarChart
  data={[
    { runtime: 'Node.js', requestsPerSec: 45000, avgLatency: 22 },
    { runtime: 'Bun', requestsPerSec: 98000, avgLatency: 10 },
    { runtime: 'Deno', requestsPerSec: 52000, avgLatency: 19 }
  ]}
  xKey="runtime"
  bars={[
    { key: 'requestsPerSec', label: 'Requests/sec', color: '#E1F748' },
    { key: 'avgLatency', label: 'Avg Latency (ms)', color: '#a3a3a3' }
  ]}

/>

As we can see from the chart above, **Bun leads significantly** in both requests per second and latency. This is primarily due to its use of JavaScriptCore and highly optimized networking layer.

## File I/O Operations

File system operations are critical for many applications. Here's how the runtimes compare when reading and writing files:

<BarChart
  data={[
    { operation: 'Read (1MB)', nodejs: 85, bun: 120, deno: 78 },
    { operation: 'Write (1MB)', nodejs: 92, bun: 145, deno: 88 },
    { operation: 'Read (10MB)', nodejs: 380, bun: 520, deno: 350 }
  ]}
  xKey="operation"
  bars={[
    { key: 'nodejs', label: 'Node.js (MB/s)', color: '#E1F748' },
    { key: 'bun', label: 'Bun (MB/s)', color: '#ffffff' },
    { key: 'deno', label: 'Deno (MB/s)', color: '#666666' }
  ]}
  title="File I/O Performance (MB/s)"
/>

Bun shows impressive file I/O performance, particularly for write operations. Node.js and Deno perform similarly, with Deno being slightly slower due to its additional security checks.

## Cold Start Time

For serverless environments and CLI tools, cold start time is crucial. Let's compare how quickly each runtime can execute a simple script:

<BarChart
  data={[
    { runtime: 'Node.js', coldStart: 45 },
    { runtime: 'Bun', coldStart: 12 },
    { runtime: 'Deno', coldStart: 35 }
  ]}
  xKey="runtime"
  bars={[
    { key: 'coldStart', label: 'Cold Start Time (ms)', color: '#E1F748' }
  ]}
  title="Cold Start Performance"

/>

Bun's cold start time is remarkably fast at just 12ms, making it ideal for CLI tools and serverless functions. Node.js is the slowest at 45ms, while Deno sits comfortably in the middle.

## Key Takeaways

Based on our performance analysis:

- **Bun** excels in raw performance metrics across the board, particularly for HTTP servers and file I/O
- **Node.js** remains a solid choice with its mature ecosystem and predictable performance
- **Deno** offers a good balance of performance and security, with TypeScript support built-in

The choice of runtime should depend on your specific use case. For performance-critical applications, Bun is hard to beat. For established projects with extensive npm dependencies, Node.js is still the safe choice. For new projects that prioritize security and modern standards, Deno is worth considering.

## Methodology

All benchmarks were conducted on:
- CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5900X
- RAM: 32GB DDR4
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Runtime versions: Node.js 20.10, Bun 1.0.15, Deno 1.38

Each test was run 100 times, and the median values are reported to minimize the impact of outliers.
